- Subsequent requests should be faster (3-7 seconds)
- This is normal for local AI processing

### Issue: Questions not generating

**Check:**
1. Ollama service is running: `ollama list`
2. Llama3 model is available
3. No network issues with localhost:11434
4. Browser console for detailed errors

### Issue: Frontend build errors

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install

# Restart dev server
pnpm dev
```
